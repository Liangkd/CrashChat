## News
- [25.12.18] ![NEW!](https://img.shields.io/badge/NEW!-red) Release the initial version of **CrashChat**.


## Introduction
- **CrashChat** is a Multimodal Large Language Model specifically designed for traffic crash video analysis. Our model incorporates three key architectural contributions: 
  - (1) a multitask learning approach designed to effectively inject the comprehensive knowledge of crash video analysis into VideoLLaMA3;
  - (2) an MLLM capable of unified crash recognition, temporal grounding, and understanding across diverse scenarios;
  - (3) a comprehensive evaluation that provides the first benchmarking of MLLMs for end-to-end crash video analysis.
- We also construct an instruction-tuning crash video dataset, encompassing six core tasks and a total of 18,398 videos and 96,262 video-QA pairs, to further enhance CrashChat's performance.
